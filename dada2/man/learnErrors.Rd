\title{Learns the error rates from an input list, or vector, of file names or a list of \code{\link{derep-class}} objects.}
\usage{
learnErrors(fls, nreads = 1e+06, errorEstimationFunction = loessErrfun,
  multithread = FALSE, randomize = FALSE, MAX_CONSIST = 10, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{fls}{(Required). \code{character}.
The file path(s) to the fastq, fastq.gz file(s), or any file format supported by \code{\link[ShortRead]{FastqStreamer}}.
A list of derep-class ojects can also be provided.}

\item{nreads}{(Optional). Default 1e6.
The minimum number of reads to use for error rate learning. Samples are read into memory
until at least this number of reads has been reached, or all provided samples have been
read in.}

\item{errorEstimationFunction}{(Optional). Function. Default \code{\link{loessErrfun}}.

 \code{errorEstimationFunction} is computed on the matrix of observed transitions
 after each sample inference step in order to generate the new matrix of estimated error rates.}

\item{multithread}{(Optional). Default is FALSE.
If TRUE, multithreading is enabled and the number of available threads is automatically determined.   
If an integer is provided, the number of threads to use is set by passing the argument on to
\code{\link{setThreadOptions}}.}

\item{randomize}{(Optional). Default FALSE.
If FALSE, samples are read in the provided order until enough reads are obtained.
If TRUE, samples are picked at random from those provided.}

\item{MAX_CONSIST}{(Optional). Default 10.
The maximum number of times to step through the self-consistency loop. If convergence was not
reached in MAX_CONSIST steps, the estimated error rates in the last step are returned.}

\item{...}{(Optional). Additional arguments will be passed on to the \code{\link{dada}} function.}
}
\value{
A named list with three entries:
 $err_out: A numeric matrix with the learned error rates.
 $err_in: The initialization error rates (unimportant).
 $trans: A feature table of observed transitions for each type (eg. A->C) and quality score.
}
\description{
Error rates are learned by alternating between sample inference and error rate estimation 
 until convergence. Sample inferences is performed by the \code{\link{dada}} function.
 Error rate estimation is performed by \code{errorEstimationFunction}.
 The output of this function serves as input to the dada function call as the \code{err} parameter.

 fl1 <- system.file("extdata", "sam1F.fastq.gz", package="dada2")

 err <- learnErrors(c(fl1, fl2), nreads=50000, randomize=TRUE)
